This project is meant to accept a stock ticker (ex. AMZN, AAPL, FB, TSLA) and provide a company overview, financials, and company news. 
This project utilizes Vue.js and Bootstrap 4 alongside multiple stock APIs (Finnhub and AlphaVantage).
Future updates will include sections for historical income statements and balance sheets alongside mobile responsiveness.
